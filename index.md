## About Me As A Person
I am a second year CS student in Sixth college. Some of my hobbies are: 
* Fishing
* Playing basketball
* Playing video games. 

If I had to rank them in terms of how much time I spend doing each, I would say this would be the order:
1. Playing basketball
2. Fishing
3. Playing video games

Nonetheless, I still like them all. Here are some visual images of the above activities.

It's kind of interesting though because video games used to be how I spent most of my days, while now I barely play them. However, when I do play, I play Valorant [Valorant image](EGS_VALORANT_RiotGames_S1_2560x1440-91dc9490f14942ad5eeef278eb3ef4a6.jpeg)

## About Me As A Programmer
My **favorite** programming language is *Python*. I like its simple syntax, such as just being able to write 
```
print("Hello World")
```
This wasn't always the case though, as there were times where I even complained about Python when I first started programming. My friend's at the time told me:
>Haha, just wait til you have to use C++

A cool fact is this is my first time using Markdown. I learned these constructs just now using this website that was [linked in the assignment page](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax). 

It's pretty cool that I've already written all this, as just recently I feel like I was writing [The First Header](#my-name-is-sarkis-and-this-is-my-user-page)

These are some of the things I look forward to doing next: 
- [x] Do my first assignment using markup 
- [ ] Do something voluntarily using markup 
- [ ] Expand and use a wider tech stack
